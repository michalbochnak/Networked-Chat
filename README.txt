Since program Networked Chat requires prime numbers for RSA encryption/decryption, 
the main folder Networked-Chat contains file named “primeNumbers.rsc”. 
If the user wants to provide his own file with his prime numbers of choice, 
the original file MUST be replaced. However, the name for new file MUST be the 
same “primeNumbers.rsc”. If the name doesn’t match, then the application will force 
user to enter 2 prime numbers from keyboard. Additionally, program uses encryption for 
the block size of 4 characters, meaning user is required provide the two numbers(p,q) 
where p*q (product of p and q) MUST be greater than 268,435,456 but less than 2,147,483,647
